  This dataset comes from the International Organization for Migration (IOM)'s
  displacement tracking matrix (DTM)
  [publicly accessible API](https://dtm.iom.int/data-and-analysis/dtm-api).
  This API allows the humanitarian community, academia, media, government,
  and non-governmental organizations to utilize the data collected by DTM.
  The DTM API only provides non-sensitive IDP figures, aggregated at the
  country, Admin 1 (states, provinces, or equivalent), and Admin 2
  (smaller subnational administrative areas) levels. For more detailed
  information, please see the
